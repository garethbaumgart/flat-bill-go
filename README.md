# Utility Bill Generator App

## Overview
This app is designed to simplify the process of generating monthly utility bills for a single residential property, such as a flat or apartment. It is intended for landlords or property managers who need to calculate and view utility costs (electricity, water, sanitation) for one property. The app is targeted at South Africa, using South African Rands (ZAR) as the currency and a static, hardcoded 15% VAT rate. The app will be available on desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux) and mobile (iOS, Android) platforms using Flutter.

The app allows users to enter meter readings and tariff rates for electricity, water, and sanitation, automatically calculates totals (including VAT), and generates a professional bill summary for on-screen viewing. All data is stored locally on the deviceâ€”no sign-up, login, or cloud storage is required for the MVP.
